- Project 1:
I did the Kattis probelm "sodasurpler." The files "TestCase1" and "TestCase2" are .png screenshots of the two test cases passing. 
SOLUTION: https://github.com/sapsey19/CSCI310/tree/master/SodaSurpler/src/main/java/com/github/sapsey19/sodasurpler

Nice work!


- Project 2:
I created a type of roster that lets the user add players, along with their sport and school year. There are also methods to remove 
players, check if a player is in the list, and return the sport and school year of the player. The roster implements an ArrayList.

- Project 3: 
I created a program that sorts arrays on different threads. Then I compare the time of the sorts (quicksort, selectsort, and bubblesort), and assert that quicksort is the fastest, and bubble is the slowest. 
SOLUTION: https://github.com/sapsey19/CSCI310/tree/master/ThreadingArrays/src/main/java/com/github/sapsey19/threadingarrays


- Project 4:
I created a database that stores the names of menu items, along with their menu number and price. The testing file tests for creation, updates, reads, and deletes. There is a screenshot with the tests passing in the Database folder. 
SOLUTION: https://github.com/sapsey19/CSCI310/tree/master/Database/src/test/java/com/github/sapsey19/database

- Project 5:
I created a simple two-activity app that displays text and switches from one activity to the other.

- Final Project
I created a small game in Android Studio. The program is multi-threaded, with multiple classes. I followed a tutorial to get the game loop set up, which forms the backbone of my game. The tutorial can be found here: https://youtu.be/OojQitoAEXs

I added Unit Tests to make sure that the obstacle manager was correctly added obstacles. A screenshot of the tests passing can be found here: https://github.com/sapsey19/CSCI310/blob/master/Game/PassedTest.png
