#CSCI310

- Project 1:
I did the Kattis probelm "sodasurpler." The files "TestCase1" and "TestCase2" are .png screenshots of the two test cases passing.

Nice work!


- Project 2:
I created a type of roster that lets the user add players, along with their sport and school year. There are also methods to remove 
players, check if a player is in the list, and return the sport and school year of the player. The roster implements an ArrayList.

- Project 3: 
I created a program that sorts arrays on different threads. Then I compare the time of the sorts (quicksort, selectsort, and bubblesort), and assert that quicksort is the fastest, and bubble is the slowest.

- Project 4
I created a database that stores the names of menu items, along with their menu number and price. The testing file tests for creation, updates, reads, and deletes. There is a screenshot with the tests passing in the Database folder.
